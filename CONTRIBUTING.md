## Notes to contributors

Stick to the structure, design choices and style conventions described
below. For questions: please contact the
[author](mailto:manuel-rademaker@outlook.de).

<!-- ### Structure -->
<!-- The package structure is best understood with reference to a (hierarchically organized)  -->
<!-- company. In analogy to company departments, two separate "function departments"  -->
<!-- exist: -->
<!-- - **Estimation functions** -->
<!-- - **Postestimation functions** -->
<!-- Each department is hierarchically structured. All functions that do not belong -->
<!-- to one of the departments are considered **utility functions**. To stay in the -->
<!-- picture, they are best understood as external consultants in charge of one -->
<!-- specific task that is not meaningfully classified as belonging to (only) one of -->
<!-- the two departments. -->
<!-- #### Estimation functions: -->
<!-- Estimation functions are all functions involved in the estimation/calculation  -->
<!-- of the quantities of the measurement and the path/structural model. There are: -->
<!-- - **2 toplevel functions** (`csem()`). These functions + the -->
<!--   postestimation function `summarize()` (see below) should be sufficient for the end -->
<!--   user most of the time. Both functions eventually call `foreman()`. -->
<!-- - **1 midlevel function**, `foreman()`, that acts like a foreman by collecting all -->
<!--   (estimation) tasks, distributing them to lower level (helper) functions, and  -->
<!--   eventually recollecting all of their results. -->
<!-- - **Lowlevel (helper) functions** that perform one specific task. A distinction -->
<!--   is made between: -->
<!--     - **Exported helper functions**: Functions that are exported to be applied -->
<!--       directly by the end user if needed (e.g. `parseModel()` or -->
<!--       `calculateWeightsPLS()`). -->
<!--     - **Internal helper functions**: Functions that are not exported. These functions  -->
<!--       can be accessed via `csem:::` but they are not generally useful to the end user -->
<!--       (e.g. `calculateConstructVCV()` or `classifyConstructs()`).  -->
<!-- #### Postestimation functions: -->
<!-- Postestimation functions are functions to be applied to an object resulting  -->
<!-- from a call to `csem()`, `cca()` or `foreman()`, namely a `cSEMResults` object.  -->
<!-- All postestimation functions are consistently named by (preferably short) verbs. -->
<!-- Postestimation functions are generic with methods for classes `cSEMResults_default`, -->
<!-- `cSEMResults_multi` and `cSEMResults_2ndorder`. -->
<!-- Currently only a subset of these functions is implemented: -->
<!-- - 1 toplevel function:  -->
<!--   - `summarize()` with class `cSEMSummarize` -->
<!-- - 2 midlevel functions: -->
<!--   - `assess()` with class `cSEMCheck` -->
<!--   - `verify` with class `cSEMVerify` -->
<!-- - 3 lowlevel functions: -->
<!--   - `testMICOM()` with class `cSEMTestMICOM` -->
<!--   - `testMGD()` with class `cSEMTestMGA` -->
<!--   - `testOMF()` with class `cSEMTestOMF` -->
<!-- Each function has (will eventually have) a distinct class and a corresponding  -->
<!-- `print` method. -->
<!-- ### Helper functions -->
<!-- #### Exported helper functions -->
<!-- Exported helper functions should be written as autonomous as possible in a sense  -->
<!-- that they can be used without having to jump to a mother function in order to allow  -->
<!-- researchers using the package to use helper function the way they need it.  -->
<!-- Flexibility will come at the price of code repetition (i.e. most exported helper  -->
<!-- functions will have to have a `parseModel()` + `processDate()` statement at the  -->
<!-- beginning) to make them autonomous. -->
<!-- #### Internal helper functions -->
<!-- Internal helper functions on the other hand do not need to be autonomous. Here -->
<!-- code compactness is preferred.  -->
<!-- Mark every internal function as internal with `@keywords internal`. -->

### General design choices

-   The only OO system used is the S3 system. No S4 classes will be
    allowed!
-   Whenever you subset a matrix using `[` use:
    `[..., ..., drop = FALSE]` to avoid accidentally dropping the `dim`
    attributes.
-   Generally avoid using attributes (sometimes they are meaningful
    though)
-   Whenever the output consists of more than 1 element use a named
    list!

### Style/Naming

Stick to [this styleguide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) with the
following exceptions/additions:

1.  Function and class names are always CamelCase. Function names should
    contain a verb followed by a noun like: `processData()`,
    `calculateValue()`.
2.  Verbs in function names should be consistent across the whole
    package. Avoid mixing synonyms. Example: `computeValue()`
    vs. `calculateValue()`. This package always uses `calculate` instead
    of `compute`. Similarly, `method` vs e.g. `approach`. This package
    always uses `approach` instead of `method`.
3.  Use plural in function/object names if the main output is more than
    one element, like `scaleWeights()`, `calculateComposites()`,
    `handleArgs()` etc. but stick to singular in other cases like
    `parseModel()`.
4.  Strive for meaningful argument names even if they are a bit longer
    than usual. People are much better at remembering arguments like
    `respect_structural_model` compared to something like `resp_sm`.
    Naming should also be consistent if possible. For example: any
    argument that describes a method or an approach should be named
    `.approach_*`.
5.  Argument names always start with a dot to distinguish them from
    other objects.
6.  Indentation: It is OK to align function arguments indented by two
    spaces below the function name instead of where the function starts
    if this help with readability.

``` r
## Both ok but second is prefered in this case
calculateInnerWeightsPLS <- function(.S                           = NULL,
                                     .W                           = NULL,
                                     .csem_model                  = NULL,
                                     .PLS_weight_scheme_inner     = c("centroid",
                                                                      "factorial", 
                                                                      "path"),
                                     .PLS_ignore_structural_model = NULL
                                     ) { }

calculateInnerWeightsPLS <- function(
  .S                            = NULL,
  .W                            = NULL,
  .csem_model                   = NULL,
  .PLS_weight_scheme_inner      = c("centroid","factorial", "path"),
  .PLS_ignore_structural_model  = NULL
  ) { }
```

### Matrices

-   Whenever possible: variables belong in columns, observations belong
    to rows. This implies: whenever a matrix contains observations,
    variables are in columns, no matter if they are indicators, proxies,
    errors or anything else.
-   Covariance matrices: indicators **always** belong to columns and
    proxies to rows, i.e., the matrix of weights *W* for PLS is
    therefore (*J* × *K*) where *J* is the number of proxies and *K* the
    number of indicators.
-   Naming: matrices within the package should be named according to the
    naming schemes of the related SEM literature.

### Arguments

All arguments used by any of the functions in the package (including
internal functions) are centrally collected in the file
`zz_arguments.R`. Whenever a new argument is introduced:

1.  Add the new argument name + a description to the `cSEMArguments`
    list in alphabetical order by writing
    `@param <argument> "Some description". "Defaults to xxx".`
2.  Add the argument to the `args` or the `args_dotdotdot_csem` list of
    the `args_default()` function and provide a default value.
    -   Arguments for `args_dotdotdot_csem`: all arguments that can be
        used when calling `csem()` or `cca()` . Practically this
        comprises all formal arguments of `foreman()` that are not
        formal arguments of `csem()`.
    -   Arguments for `args`: all other arguments.
3.  Add the argument to the function you want to use it in. Order
    arguments according to their importance (i.e. `.data` and `.model`
    always come first). if there is one otherwise use alphabetical
    order.
