# cSEM: a package for composite-based SEM <img src='man/figures/cSEMsticker.svg' align="right" height="200" /></a>

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cSEM)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cSEM)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/M-E-Rademaker/cSEM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/M-E-Rademaker/cSEM)

WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. BREAKING CHANGES TO THE API ARE VERY LIKELY. 
         Use the package with caution and please report bugs to [the package developers](mailto:manuel.rademaker@uni-wuerzburg.de;f.schuberth@utwente.nl). 
         The first stable relase will be version 0.0.1, most likely in mid 2019.

## Purpose

Estimate, analyse, test, and study linear, nonlinear, hierachical structural 
equation models using composite-based approaches and procedures, including 
estimation techniques such as partial least squares path 
modeling (PLS-PM) and its derivatives (PLSc, OrdPLSc, robustPLSc), generalized 
structured component analysis (GSCA), generalized structured component 
analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm), generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA),
principal component analysis (PCA), factor score regression (FSR) using
sum score, regression or bartlett scores (including bias correction using
Croon's approach), as well as several tests and typical postestimation 
procedures (e.g., verify admissibility of the estimates, assess the model fit, 
test the model fit, compute confidence intervals, compare groups, etc.).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Currently only a development version from GitHub is available:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("M-E-Rademaker/cSEM")
```

## Getting started

The best place to get started is the [cSEM-website](https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/) (Work in progress).

## Philosophy

- Above all: user-centered design!
- Easy to use by non-R experts: 
    - One central function `csem()` provides default choices for most of its arguments 
      (similarity to the `sem()` and `cfa()` functions of the [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) 
      package is intended).
    - Well documented (vignettes, HTML output, a website, (eventually) intro course(s) and cheatsheets)
    - Structured output/results  that aims to be "easy"" in a sense that it is
        - ... descriptive/verbose
        - ... (eventually) easy to export to other environments such as MS Word, Latex files etc. (exportability)
        - ... (eventually) easy to migrate from/to/between other PLS/VB/CB-based systems (lavaan, semPLS, ADANCO, SmartPLS)
- The package is designed to be flexible/modular enough so that researchers 
  developing new methods can take specific function provided by the package and 
  alter them according to their need without working their way through a chain
  of other functions (naturally this will not always be possible). Modularity is
  largly inspired by the `matrixpls` package.
- Modern in a sense that the package integrates modern developments within 
  the R community. This mainly includes ideas/recommendations/design choices that
  fead into the packages of the [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse).
- State of the art in a sense that we seek to quickly implement recent methodological
  developments in composite-based SEM. 
  
## Basic usage

The basic usage is illustrated below.

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/api.png")
```

Roughly speaking using `cSEM` is always the same 3 step procedure

> 1. Pick a dataset and specify a model using [lavaan syntax](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html)
> 2. Use `csem()`
> 3. Apply one of the postestimation functions listed below on the resulting object.


## Postestimation functions

Currently we have five major postestimation verbs. 

- `assess()` : assess the model using common quality criteria
- `infer()` : calculate common inferencial quantities (e.g, standard errors)
- `predict()` : predict indicator values (not yet implemented)
- `summarize()` : summarize the results
- `verify()` : verify admissibility of the estimates

Tests are performed by using the test family of functions. Currently the following
tests are implemented.

- `testOMF()` : performs a test for overall model fit
- `testMICOM()` : performs a test for composite measurement invariance
- `testMGD` : performs several test to assess multi-group differences
- `testHausman()` : performs the regression-based Hausman test to test for endogeneity.

All functions require a `cSEMResults` object.

## Example
Models are defined using [lavaan syntax](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html) 
with some slight modifications. For illustration we use the build-in and well-known 
`satisfaction` dataset.

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(cSEM)
data(satisfaction)
    
## Note: The operator "<~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modelled
##       as a composite.
##       The operator "=~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modelled
##       as a common factor.
##       The operator "~" tells cSEM which are the dependent (left-hand side) and
##       independent variables (right-hand side).
    
model <- "
# Structural model
EXPE ~ IMAG
QUAL ~ EXPE
VAL  ~ EXPE + QUAL
SAT  ~ IMAG + EXPE + QUAL + VAL 
LOY  ~ IMAG + SAT

# Composite model
IMAG <~ imag1 + imag2 + imag3
EXPE <~ expe1 + expe2 + expe3 
QUAL <~ qual1 + qual2 + qual3 + qual4 + qual5
VAL  <~ val1  + val2  + val3

# Reflective measurement model
SAT  =~ sat1  + sat2  + sat3  + sat4
LOY  =~ loy1  + loy2  + loy3  + loy4
"
```
Estimation is conducted by the `csem()` function.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Estimate using defaults
res <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model)

# This is equal to
csem(
   .data                        = satisfaction,
   .model                       = model,
   .approach_cor_robust         = "none",
   .approach_nl                 = "sequential",
   .approach_paths              = "OLS",
   .approach_weights            = "PLS-PM",
   .conv_criterion              = "diff_absolute",
   .disattenuate                = TRUE,
   .dominant_indicators         = NULL,
   .estimate_structural         = TRUE,
   .id                          = NULL,
   .iter_max                    = 100,
   .normality                   = FALSE,
   .PLS_approach_cf             = "dist_squared_euclid",
   .PLS_ignore_structural_model = FALSE,
   .PLS_modes                   = NULL,
   .PLS_weight_scheme_inner     = "path",
   .reliabilities               = NULL,
   .starting_values             = NULL,
   .tolerance                   = 1e-05,
   .resample_method             = "none", 
   .resample_method2            = "none",
   .R                           = 499,
   .R2                          = 199,
   .handle_inadmissibles        = "drop",
   .user_funs                   = NULL,
   .eval_plan                   = "sequential",
   .seed                        = NULL,
   .sign_change_option          = "none"
    )
```

The result is always an object of class `cSEMResults`. Technically, the resulting
object has at least one additional class attribute (namely `cSEMResults_default`, `cSEMResults_multi`
or `cSEMResults_2ndorder`), however, users usually do not need to care about since postestimation
functions (will eventually) automatically work on all classes. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Access elements using `$`. E.g.:
res$Estimates$Loading_estimates 
res$Information$Model
    
## Examine the structure:
listviewer::jsonedit(res, mode = "view") # requires the listviewer package.
    
## Get a summary
summarize(res) 
    
## Apply postestimation functions, e.g.
verify(res) 
    
## Test overall model fit
testOMF(res)

## Assess the model
assess(res)
```

#### Inference

By default no inferential quantities are calculated since most composite-based estimators 
have no closed-form expressions for standard errors. Some closed form standard error 
are implemented, however, this feature is still rather preliminary.
It is therefore recommoned to use resampling instead. `cSEM` mostly relies on the 
 `bootstrap` procedure (although `jackknife` is implemented as well) to estimate
standard errors, test statistics, and critical quantiles.

`cSEM` offers two ways to compute resamples:

1. Setting `.resample_method` to `"jackkinfe"` or `"bootstrap"` and subsequently using 
   postestimation functions `summarize()` or `infer()`.
2. The same result is achieved by passing a `cSEMResults` object to `resamplecSEMResults()`
   and subsequently using postestimation functions `summarize()` or `infer()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Setting `.resample_method`
b1 <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model, .resample_method = "bootstrap")
b2 <- resamplecSEMResults(res)
```

Several resample-based confidence intervals are implemented, see `?infer()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
summarize(b1)
infer(b1, .quantity = c("CI_standard_z", "CI_percentile")) # no print method yet
```

Both bootstrap and jackknife resampling support platform-independent multiprocessing 
as well as setting random seeds via the [future framework](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future). 
For multiprocessing simply set `.eval_plan = "multiprocess"` in which case the maximum number of available cores
is used if not on Windows. On Windows as many separate R instances are opened in the
backround as there are cores available instead. Note
that this naturally has some overhead so for a small number of resamples multiprocessing
will not always be faster compared to sequential (single core) processing (the default).
Seeds are set via the `.seed` argument.

```{r eval=FALSE}
b <- csem(
  .data            = satisfaction,
  .model           = model, 
  .resample_method = "bootstrap",
  .R               = 999,
  .seed            = 98234,
  .eval_plan       = "multiprocess")
```
