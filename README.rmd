## Purpose

Estimate, analyse, test, and study linear, nonlinear, hierarchical and
multi-group structural equation models using composite-based approaches and procedures, including 
estimation techniques such as partial least squares path 
modeling (PLS-PM) and its derivatives (PLSc, OrdPLSc, robustPLSc), generalized 
structured component analysis (GSCA), generalized structured component 
analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm), generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA),
principal component analysis (PCA), factor score regression (FSR) using
sum score, regression or Bartlett scores (including bias correction using
Croon's approach), as well as several tests and typical post-estimation 
procedures (e.g., verify admissibility of the estimates, assess the model fit, 
test the model fit, compute confidence intervals, compare groups, etc.).

## News (2022-05-09):

- `predict()` function is now able to predict categorical indicators (a procedure known as
   OrdPLScPredict). 

- Use singular value decomposition in GSCAm to deal with large datasets, which allows for large datasets (thanks to Heungsun Hwang)

## Installation
The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cSEM")
```

To install the development version, which is recommended, use:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("M-E-Rademaker/cSEM")
```

## Getting started

The best place to get started is the [cSEM-website](https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/).
  
## Basic usage

The basic usage is illustrated below.

<div class = "white">
```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE} 
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/41042148
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/api.png")
```
</div>

Usually, using `cSEM` is the same 3 step procedure:

> 1. Pick a dataset and specify a model using [lavaan syntax](https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html)
> 2. Use `csem()`
> 3. Apply one of the post-estimation functions listed below on the resulting object.

## Post-estimation functions

There are five major post-estimation verbs, three test family functions and
three do-family of function: 

- `assess()` : assess the model using common quality criteria
- `infer()` : calculate common inferential quantities (e.g., standard errors, confidence intervals)
- `predict()` : predict endogenous indicator values
- `summarize()` : summarize the results
- `verify()` : verify admissibility of the estimates

Tests are performed by using the test family of functions. Currently, the following
tests are implemented:

- `testOMF()` : performs a test for overall model fit
- `testMICOM()` : performs a test for composite measurement invariance
- `testMGD()` : performs several tests to assess multi-group differences
- `testHausman()` : performs the regression-based Hausman test to test for endogeneity

Other miscellaneous post-estimation functions belong do the do-family of functions.
Currently, three do functions are implemented:

- `doIPMA()`: performs an importance-performance matrix analysis
- `doNonlinearEffectsAnalysis()`: performs a nonlinear effects analysis such as 
   floodlight and surface analysis
- `doRedundancyAnalysis()`: performs a redundancy analysis

All functions require a `cSEMResults` object.

## Example
Models are defined using [lavaan syntax](https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html) 
with some slight modifications (see the [Specifying a model](https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/cSEM.html#using-csem) section on the [cSEM-website](https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/)). For illustration we use the build-in and well-known 
`satisfaction` dataset.

```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(cSEM)
    
## Note: The operator "<~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modeled
##       as a composite.
##       The operator "=~" tells cSEM that the construct to its left is modeled
##       as a common factor.
##       The operator "~" tells cSEM which are the dependent (left-hand side) and
##       independent variables (right-hand side).
    
model <- "
# Structural model
EXPE ~ IMAG
QUAL ~ EXPE
VAL  ~ EXPE + QUAL
SAT  ~ IMAG + EXPE + QUAL + VAL 
LOY  ~ IMAG + SAT

# Composite model
IMAG <~ imag1 + imag2 + imag3
EXPE <~ expe1 + expe2 + expe3 
QUAL <~ qual1 + qual2 + qual3 + qual4 + qual5
VAL  <~ val1  + val2  + val3

# Reflective measurement model
SAT  =~ sat1  + sat2  + sat3  + sat4
LOY  =~ loy1  + loy2  + loy3  + loy4
"
```
The estimation is conducted using the `csem()` function.
```{r }
# Estimate using defaults
res <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model)
res
```
This is equal to:
```{r eval=FALSE}
csem(
   .data                        = satisfaction,
   .model                       = model,
   .approach_cor_robust         = "none",
   .approach_nl                 = "sequential",
   .approach_paths              = "OLS",
   .approach_weights            = "PLS-PM",
   .conv_criterion              = "diff_absolute",
   .disattenuate                = TRUE,
   .dominant_indicators         = NULL,
   .estimate_structural         = TRUE,
   .id                          = NULL,
   .iter_max                    = 100,
   .normality                   = FALSE,
   .PLS_approach_cf             = "dist_squared_euclid",
   .PLS_ignore_structural_model = FALSE,
   .PLS_modes                   = NULL,
   .PLS_weight_scheme_inner     = "path",
   .reliabilities               = NULL,
   .starting_values             = NULL,
   .tolerance                   = 1e-05,
   .resample_method             = "none", 
   .resample_method2            = "none",
   .R                           = 499,
   .R2                          = 199,
   .handle_inadmissibles        = "drop",
   .user_funs                   = NULL,
   .eval_plan                   = "sequential",
   .seed                        = NULL,
   .sign_change_option          = "none"
    )
```

The result is always a named list of class `cSEMResults`. 

To access list elements use `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
res$Estimates$Loading_estimates 
res$Information$Model
```

A useful tool to examine a list is the [listviewer package](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/listviewer/). 
If you are new to `cSEM` this might be a good way to familiarize yourself with the structure
of a `cSEMResults` object.

```{r eval=FALSE}
listviewer::jsonedit(res, mode = "view") # requires the listviewer package.
```

Apply post-estimation functions:
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
rnorm(1) # necessary to initialize a .Random.seed object
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Get a summary
summarize(res) 
    
## Verify admissibility of the results
verify(res) 
    
## Test overall model fit
testOMF(res)

## Assess the model
assess(res)

## Predict indicator scores of endogenous constructs
predict(res)
```

#### Resampling and Inference

By default no inferential statistics are calculated since most composite-based estimators 
have no closed-form expressions for standard errors. Resampling is used instead.
`cSEM` mostly relies on the `bootstrap` procedure (although `jackknife` is implemented as well)
to estimate standard errors, test statistics, and critical quantiles.

`cSEM` offers two ways for resampling:

1. Setting `.resample_method` in `csem()` to `"jackknife"` or `"bootstrap"` and subsequently using 
   post-estimation functions `summarize()` or `infer()`.
2. The same result is achieved by passing a `cSEMResults` object to `resamplecSEMResults()`
   and subsequently using post-estimation functions `summarize()` or `infer()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Setting `.resample_method`
b1 <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model, .resample_method = "bootstrap")
# Using resamplecSEMResults()
b2 <- resamplecSEMResults(res)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
b1 <- csem(.data = satisfaction, .model = model, .resample_method = "bootstrap")
```

The `summarize()` function reports the inferential statistics:

```{r}
summarize(b1)
```

Several bootstrap-based confidence intervals are implemented, see `?infer()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
infer(b1, .quantity = c("CI_standard_z", "CI_percentile")) # no print method yet
```

Both bootstrap and jackknife resampling support platform-independent multiprocessing 
as well as setting random seeds via the [future framework](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/). 
For multiprocessing simply set `.eval_plan = "multisession"` in which case the maximum number of available cores
is used if not on Windows. On Windows as many separate R instances are opened in the
background as there are cores available instead. Note
that this naturally has some overhead so for a small number of resamples multiprocessing
will not always be faster compared to sequential (single core) processing (the default).
Seeds are set via the `.seed` argument.

```{r eval=FALSE}
b <- csem(
  .data            = satisfaction,
  .model           = model, 
  .resample_method = "bootstrap",
  .R               = 999,
  .seed            = 98234,
  .eval_plan       = "multisession")
```
