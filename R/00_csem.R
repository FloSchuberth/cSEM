#' Composite-based SEM
#'
#' Estimate linear, nonlinear, hierarchical or multigroup structural equation
#' models using a composite-based approach. In \pkg{cSEM} 
#' any method or approach that involves linear compounds (scores/proxies/composites)
#' of observables (indicators/items/manifest variables) is defined as composite-based.
#' See the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/cSEM.html}{Get started} 
#' section of the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/index.html}{cSEM website}
#' for a general introduction to composite-based SEM and \pkg{cSEM}.
#'
#' `csem()` estimates linear, nonlinear, hierarchical  or multigroup structural 
#' equation models using a composite-based approach. 
#' 
#' \subsection{Data and model:}{
#' The `.data` and `.model` arguments are required. `.data` must be given
#' a `matrix` or a `data.frame` with column names matching
#' the indicator names used in the model description. Alternatively, 
#' a `list` of data sets (matrices or data frames) may be provided
#' in which case estimation is repeated for each data set. 
#' Possible column types/classes of the data provided are: "`logical`", 
#' "`numeric`" ("`double`" or "`integer`"), "`factor`" ("`ordered`" and/or "`unordered`"),
#' "`character`", or a mix of several types. Character columns will be treated 
#' as (unordered) factors.
#' 
#' Depending on the type/class of the indicator data provided cSEM computes the indicator 
#' correlation matrix in different ways. See [calculateIndicatorCor()] for details.
#'
#' In the current version `.data` must not contain missing values. Future versions
#' are likely to handle missing values as well.
#' 
#' To provide a model use the [lavaan model syntax][lavaan::model.syntax].
#' Note, however, that \pkg{cSEM} currently only supports the "standard" lavaan
#' model syntax (Types 1, 2, 3, and 7 as described on the help page). 
#' Therefore, specifying e.g., a threshold or scaling factors is ignored. 
#' Alternatively, a standardized (possibly incomplete) [cSEMModel]-list may be supplied.
#' See [parseModel()] for details.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Weights and path coefficients:}{
#' By default weights are estimated using the partial least squares path modeling 
#' algorithm (`"PLS-PM"`).
#' A range of alternative weighting algorithms may be supplied to 
#' `.approach_weights`. Currently, the following approaches are implemented 
#' \enumerate{
#' \item{(Default) Partial least squares path modeling (`"PLS-PM"`). The algorithm
#'    can be customized. See [calculateWeightsPLS()] for details.}
#' \item{Generalized structured component analysis (`"GSCA"`) and generalized 
#'   structured component analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm). The algorithms
#'   can be customized. See [calculateWeightsGSCA()] and [calculateWeightsGSCAm()] for details.
#'   Note that GSCAm is called indirectly when the model contains constructs
#'   modeled as common factors only and `.disattenuate = TRUE`. See below.}
#' \item{Generalized canonical correlation analysis (*GCCA*), including 
#'   `"SUMCORR"`, `"MAXVAR"`, `"SSQCORR"`, `"MINVAR"`, `"GENVAR"`.}
#' \item{Principal component analysis (`"PCA"`)}
#' \item{Factor score regression using sum scores (`"unit"`), 
#'    regression (`"regression"`) or bartlett scores (`"bartlett"`)}
#' }
#' 
#' It is possible to supply starting values for the weighting algorithm 
#' via `.starting_values`. The argument accepts a named list of vectors where the
#' list names are the construct names whose indicator weights the user
#' wishes to set. The vectors must be named vectors of `"indicator_name" = value` 
#' pairs, where `value` is the starting weight. See the examples section below for details.
#'
#' Composite-indicator and composite-composite correlations are properly
#' disattenuated by default to yield consistent loadings, construct correlations, 
#' and path coefficients if any of the concepts are modeled as a 
#' common factor. 
#' 
#' For *PLS-PM* disattenuation is done using *PLSc* \insertCite{Dijkstra2015}{cSEM}.
#' For *GSCA* disattenuation is done implicitly by using *GSCAm* \insertCite{Hwang2017}{cSEM}. 
#' Weights obtained by *GCCA*, *unit*, *regression*, *bartlett* or *PCA* are 
#' disattenuated using Croon's approach \insertCite{Croon2002}{cSEM}.
#' Disattenuation my be suppressed by setting `.disattenuate = FALSE`. 
#' Note, however, that quantities in this case are inconsistent 
#' estimates for their construct level counterparts if any of the constructs in 
#' the structural model are modeled as a common factor!
#' 
#' By default path coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (`.approach_path = "OLS"`). 
#' For linear models, two-stage least squares (`"2SLS"`) is available, however, *only if* 
#' *instruments are internal*, i.e., part of the structural model. Future versions
#' will add support for external instruments if possible. Instruments must be supplied to 
#' `.instruments` as a named list where the names
#' of the list elements are the names of the dependent constructs of the structural 
#' equations whose explanatory variables are believed to be endogenous. 
#' The list consists of vectors of names of instruments corresponding to each equation. 
#' Note that exogenous variables of a given equation **must** be supplied as 
#'instruments for themselves.
#'
#' If reliabilities are known they can be supplied as `"name" = value` pairs to 
#' `.reliabilities`, where `value` is a numeric value between 0 and 1. 
#' Currently, only supported for "PLS-PM".
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Nonlinear models:}{
#' If the model contains nonlinear terms `csem()` estimates a polynomial structural equation model
#' using a non-iterative method of moments approach described in
#' \insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}. Nonlinear terms include interactions and
#' exponential terms. The latter is described in model syntax as an
#' "interaction with itself", e.g., `xi^3 = xi.xi.xi`. Currently only exponential
#' terms up to a power of three (e.g., three-way interactions or cubic terms) are allowed.
#'
#' The current version of the package allows two kinds of estimation:
#' estimation of the reduced form equation (`.approach_nl = "replace"`) and 
#' sequential estimation (`.approach_nl = "sequential"`, the default). The latter does not 
#' allow for multivariate normality of all exogenous variables, i.e., 
#' the latent variables and the error terms.
#'
#' Distributional assumptions are kept to a minimum (an i.i.d. sample from a 
#' population with finite moments for the relevant order); for higher order models, 
#' that go beyond interaction, we work in this version with the assumption that
#' as far as the relevant moments are concerned certain combinations of 
#' measurement errors behave as if they were Gaussian.
#' For details see: \insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}.
#' }
#' 
#' \subsection{Second-order model}{
#' Second-order models are specified using the operators `=~` and `<~`. These
#' operators are usually used with indicators on their right-hand side. For 
#' second-order models the right-hand side variables are constructs instead.
#' If c1, and c2 are constructs forming or measuring a higher order
#' construct, a model would look like this:
#' \preformatted{my_model <- "
#' # Structural model
#' SAT  ~ QUAL
#' VAL  ~ SAT
#'
#' # Measurement/composite model
#' QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
#' SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2
#' 
#' c1 =~ x11 + x12
#' c2 =~ x21 + x22
#' 
#' # Second-order term (in this case a second-order composite build by common
#' # factors)
#' VAL <~ c1 + c2
#' "
#' }
#' Currently, two approaches are explicitly implemented: 
#' \itemize{
#' \item{(Default) `"2stage"`. The (disjoint) two stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Agarwal2000;textual}{cSEM}.}
#' \item{`"mixed"`. The mixed repeated indicators/two-stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Ringle2012;textual}{cSEM}.}
#' }
#' 
#' The repeated indicators approach as proposed by \insertCite{Joereskog1982b;textual}{cSEM}
#' and the extension proposed by \insertCite{Becker2012;textual}{cSEM} are 
#' not directly implemented as they simply require a respecification  of the model. 
#' In the above example the repeated indicators approach
#' would require to change the model and to append the repeated indicators to 
#' the data supplied to `.data`. Note that the indicators need to be renamed in this case as 
#' `csem()` does not allow for one indicator to be attached to multiple constructs.
#' \preformatted{my_model <- "
#' # Structural model
#' SAT  ~ QUAL
#' VAL  ~ SAT
#' 
#' VAL ~ c1 + c2
#'
#' # Measurement/composite model
#' QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
#' SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2
#' VAL  =~ x11_temp + x12_temp + x21_temp + x22_temp
#' 
#' c1 =~ x11 + x12
#' c2 =~ x21 + x22
#' "
#' }
#' According to the extended approach indirect effects of `QUAL` on `VAL` via `c1` 
#' and `c2` would have to be specified as well.
#'}
#' 
#' \subsection{Multigroup analysis}{
#' To perform multigroup analysis provide either a list of data sets or one 
#' data set containing a group-identifier-column whose column 
#' name must be provided to `.id`. Values of this column are taken as levels of a
#' factor and are interpreted as group 
#' identifiers. `csem()` will split the data by levels of that column and run
#' the estimation for each level separately. Note that the more levels
#' the group-identifier-column has, the more estimation runs are required.
#' This can considerably slow down estimation, especially if resampling is
#' requested. For the latter it will generally be faster to use 
#' `.eval_plan = "multiprocess"`.
#' } 
#' \subsection{Inference:}{
#' Inference is done via resampling. See [resamplecSEMResults()] and [infer()] for details.
