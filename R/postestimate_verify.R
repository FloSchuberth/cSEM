#' Verify admissibility of the results obtained using [csem()].
#' 
#' Results exhibiting one of the following defects are deemed inadmissible: 
#' non-convergence of the algorithm used to obtain weights, loadings and/or 
#' (congeneric) reliabilities larger than 1, a construct variance-covariance (VCV) and/or
#' model-implied VCV matrix that is not positive semi-definite.
#' 
#' If `.object` is of class `cSEMResults_2ndorder` (i.e., estimates are
#' based on a model containing second-order constructs) both the first and the second stage are checked separately.
#' 
#' Currently, a model-implied indicator VCV matrix for nonlinear model is not
#' available. `verify()` therefore skips the check for positive definiteness of the
#' model-implied indicator VCV matrix for nonlinear models and returns "ok".

#' @seealso [csem()], [summarize()], [cSEMResults]
#'
#' @return A logical vector indicating which (if any) problem occurred. 
#'   A `FALSE` indicates that the specific problem did not occurred. For models containing second-order
#'   constructs estimated by the two/three-stage approach, a list of two such vectors 
#'   (one for the first and one for the second stage) is returned. Status codes are:
#'\itemize{
#' \item 1: The algorithm has converged.
#' \item 2: All absolute standardized loading estimates are smaller than or equal to 1.
#'   A violation implies either a negative variance of the measurement error or
#'   a correlation larger than 1.
#' \item 3: The construct VCV is positive semi-definite.
#' \item 4: All reliability estimates are smaller than or equal to 1. 
#' \item 5: The model-implied indicator VCV is positive semi-definite. 
#'   This is only checked for linear models (including models containing 
#'   second-order constructs).
