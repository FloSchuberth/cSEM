# <Development version: cSEM 0.5.0.9000

- Bug fix in the predict function when the model contains only a single categorical indicator. 

- Bug fix in case of a second-order composite that is formed by one common factor. 

- Implement  `calculateRelativeGoF`. Now the relative GoF can be obtained.

- Bug fix in `calculateGoF`. Now single-indicator constructs are excluded. Thanks to Mehmet Mehmetoglu and Sergio Venturini.

- Bug fix in `calculateEffects()`. Now it is distinguished between recursive and non-recursive models. For recursive models rounding is no longer necessary.

- Bug fix in `calculateReliabilities()`. Now correction for attenuation is correctly done for PLS-PM Mode B.

# cSEM 0.5.0 (2022-05-09)

- Bug fix in `testOMF()`. Now the saturated argument is passed to the discrepancy/fit measures. 

- Bug fix in `.resampleData()` when crossvalidation is used. Empty datasets are not possible anymore. 

- Implemented several other prediction metrics.

- Bug fix: Revision of the predict metrics in the `predict` function. 

- Update the .eval_plan argument since the multiprocess argument of the future package
  is deprecated. Now multisession or multicore need to be used. Note multicore does not work on
  Windows machines. 

- Bug fix: Calculation of the R2 and adjR2 in the print function of the assess function 

- Revise the description of the two-stage approach in the csem help file (#418)

- Bug fix: fix print method for `summarize()` when disattenuate is set to TRUE internally. 
  Now disattenuate as treated in csem is reported and not the value provided by the user. (#419) 

- Use singular value decomposition in GSCAm to deal with large datasets (#444)

- Bug fix: GSCAm (i.e., `.approach_weights = "GSCA"` with constructs modeled as 
  common factors) no longer fails when a single indicator construct is supplied (#441)

- The default value for argument `.r` (the number of repetitions) of `predict()` 
  was changed from 10 to 1 since more than one repetition is hardly ever necessary.
  
- `predict()` is now able to predict categorical indicators (a procedure known as
   OrdPLScPredict). `predict()` therefore gains a number of new arguments, namely:
   `.approach_score_target`, `.sim_points`, `.treat_as_continuous`, and
   `.approach_score_benchmark`.

- Removed argument `.verbose` from `testOMF()` as it did not have any effect (#445).

- Bug fix: GSCAm (i.e., `.approach_weights = "GSCA"` with constructs modeled as 
  common factors) no longer fails when a single indicator construct is supplied (#441)
  
- Bug fix: `predict()` no longer fails when LOOCV is used (#337)

- Bug fix: fix print method for `summarize()` when resampling with constant values
  (weights or loadings) is conducted. The standard error, t-value, p-value and
  CI are properly set to `NA` now. (#433)
  
- `postestimate_test_CVPAT()`:  Perform a Cross-Validated Predictive Ability Test (CVPAT) to
  compare the predictive performance of two models (#455)

- `predict()` is now able to perform predictions either based on the earliest
   antecedents, i.e., the values of the indicators associated to exogenous constructs
   or based on the direct antecedents, i.e., based on the values or predictions 
   associated to the direct antecedents (3485)
   
- `predict()` a variety of prediction metrics are added

# cSEM 0.4.0 (2021-04-20)

### Major changes

- New function `exportToExcel()`. The function conveniently exports the results
  from `assess()`, `predict()`, `summarize()` and `testOMF()` to an .xlsx file.

### Bug fixes

- Critical bug fix: `calculateVifModeB()` did not calculate the VIFs for modeB 
  constructs correctly because of a bug in the calculation of the R^2. 
  PLEASE REVIEW YOUR CALCULATIONS in cSEM version < 0.3.1:9000! (thanks to @Benjamin Liengaard
  for pointing it out).

- Bug fix: `predict()` no longer silently returns empty predictions when `.test_data`
  does not contain rownames.

- Bug fix: calculation of the MSE in `modelSelectionCriteria()` resulted in a
  vector of incorrect length. In some cases this affected the computation 
  of "GM" and "Mallows_cp". 

# cSEM 0.3.1 (2021-02-14)

- Bug fix: `summarize()` no longer fails when `.object` is a of class 
  `cSEMResults_2ndorder` and contains no indirect effects.
  
- Add argument `type_htmt` to `calculateHTMT()`. `type_htmt = "htmt2"` calculates 
  a consistent estimator for congeneric measurement models.

# cSEM 0.3.0 (2020-12-10)

- Add lifecylce badges to postestimation functions.(#376)

- Some arguments accepted by `assess()`'s `...` argument had not been documented
  properly. This has been fixed. See `args_assess_dotdotdot` for a complete list of
  available arguments.
  
- `calculateHTMT()` now allows users to chose the type of confidence interval to
  use when computing the critical (1-alpha)% quantile of the HTMT values (#379)

- `testMGD()` gains a new `.output_type` argument. By default (`.output_type = "structured"`),
  the standard output is returned. If `.output_type = "structured"`, however, 
  a tibble (data frame) summarizing the test decisions in a user-friendly way 
  is returned. (#398)
  
- Remove warning from `fit()` when polycoric or polyserial indicator correlation 
  is used during estimation. (#413)
  
- `print.cSEMAssess()` no longer prints zero for VIF values of constructs that
   are not part of a particular structural equation.

- `print.cSEMAssess()` now prints the results of `calculateVIFModeB()`. This had been missing
  in previous releases. (#384)
  
- Breaking: `calculateVIFModeB()` now returns a matrix with the dependent construct
  in the rows and the VIFs for the coresponding weights in the columns. Previously,
  the output was a list.

- Add model selection criteria. See the `calculateModelSelectionCriteria()` 
  function for details. As usual, all criteria are available via `assess()`. (#412)

- Combine functions for surface, floodlight and simple effects analysis in 
  the `doNonlinearEffectsAnalysis()` function; Breaking: functions `doFloodlightAnalysis()`
  and `doSurfaceAnalysis()` have been removed!
  
- Progress bars are now supported for every function that does resampling. 
  Progress bars are fully customizable via the `progressr` framework created by
  @HenrikBengtsson. Note: to suppress the progress bar use
  `progressr::handlers("void")` and then run your csem commands. (#359)

- Fix bug in the computation of the Bc and Bca interval. Computation failed for
  models that had no indirect effects. 

- List element "reliability" of `assess()` is changed to "Reliability" to be 
  consistent with the naming scheme of the other list elements.

- `infer()` automatically computes bootstrap resamples now by default if `.object`
  does not have class `cSEMResults_resampled` already. (#389)

- Remove `.alpha` argument from `testMICOM()`. The argument is no longer required
  as decisions are made via (possibly adjusted) p-values. (#393)
  
- Add checks to plot methods for `predict()`, `doFloodlightAnalysis`, and,
  `doFloodlightAnalysis`.
  
- Several documentation updates and typo corrections.

- The Fornell-Larcker criterion is now computed by its own function
 `calculateFLCriterion()`. Previously, it was only available via `assess()`. (#387)

- Implement importance-performance matrix analysis via `doIPMA()`. A corresponding
  plot method is also available.

# cSEM 0.2.0 (30.03.2020)
## Major changes
  
- `testMICOM()` gains the `.approach_p_adjust` argument. The argument takes a
  single character string or a vector of character strings naming the p-value
  adjustment for multiple comparisons. (#138)
  
- Review `calculateHTMT()`. 1.) Add inference; 2) fix wrong handling of 
  single-indicator constructs (#351); 3) Remove warning produced by 
  `calculateHTMT()` when the estimated model contains
  less than 2 common factors. (#325)
  
- Breaking: Rename argument in `doFloodlightAnalysis()`. (#343)

- New function `doSurfaceAnalysis()`. See `?doSurfaceAnalysis()`(#349)

- Implement degrees of freedom calculation for second-order constructs. 

- Add new function `getConstructScores()`. The function returns the standardized
  or unstandardized construct scores. Requires a `cSEMResults` object as input. (#340)
  
- Fix bug in `doFloodlightAnalysis()`. There was an internal bug. Earlier versions
  returned the wrong direct effect. If you have used `doFloodlightAnalysis()`
  from cSEM v. 0.1.0 results are likely wrong.
  
- Export plot method for `cSEMFloodlight` objects.

- Allow users to specify a lavaan model without a structural model. Now, users
  can specify a model with several measurement equations (via `<~` or `=~`)
  but no strucutral equations. Instead the correlations between all! constructs
  must be given. Failing to do so causes an error.
  
### New example data

- Add indicator correlation matrix for a modified version of Summers (1965) model.
  See `?Sigma_Summers_composites`
  
- Add example data sets used in Henseler (2020). See `?BergamiBagozzi2000`, `?ITFlex`, 
  `?LancelotMiltgenetal2016`, `?Russett`, `?Switching`, and `?Yooetal2000`.
  
### assess()

- Update documentation and vignettes

- The following functions called by `assess()` are now exported and support all 
  of cSEM's native classes (#357, #369):
  
  - `calculateAVE()`
  - `calculateDf()`
  - `calculateGoF()`
  - `calculateHTMT()` (does not support models containing second-order constructs)
  - `calculateRhoT()`
  - `calculateRhoT()`
  - `calculatef2()`
  - `calculateDML()`
  - `calculateDG()`
  - `calculateDL()`
  - `calculateChiSquare()`
  - `calculateChiSquareDf()`
  - `calculateGFI()`
  - `calculateNFI()`
  - `calculateNNFI()`
  - `calculateIFI()`
  - `calculateCFI()`
  - `calculateSRMR()`
  - `calculateRMSEA()`
  - `calculateRMSTheta()`
  - `calculateVIFModeB()`
  
- `assess()` now supports all of cSEM's native classes. (#323)
- `assess()` now also computes and prints the total and indirect effects for each
  variable as they are often used for model assessment and may thus be considered 
  a quality criteria.
  In addition, the variance accounted for (VAF) is computed and printed as well. (#335)

- Breaking: change the name of the the quality criterion "effect size (f2)" from
  `esize` to `f2` and the corresponding function from `calculateEffectSize()` to 
  `calculatef2()`as this is more common. (#336)
  
- Add the Chi_square statistic and the Chi_square statistic divided by its
  degrees of freedom to the list of fit indices. See: `?calculateChiSquare()` 
  and `?calculateChiSquareDf()`

- Fix bug in `calculatef2()`/`assess()` when one of the equations
  of the structural model has only one explanatory variable. 
  
- Fix bug related to dotdotdot arguments incorrectly passed to functions supplied
  to `.user_funs` when resampling. Add additional example to `assess()` illustrating
  the use of the `.user_funs` arguments when given multiple functions. (#334) 

- Remove warning produced when printing a `cSEMAssess` object based on a
  model containing only constructs modeled as composites.

### predict()

- Update documentation for `predict()`.

- Integrate and document `cSEMPredict` method for generic function `plot()`. Now 
  users may call `plot()` on an object created by `predict()`. (#337)

- Add the density of the residuals as plot to `plot.cSEMPredict()`. (#337)
- Remove argument `.only_common_factors` for postestimation function `predict()`.
  Now `predict()` retruns predictions for composite models as well.
  This will break existing code that uses `predict(..., .only_common_factors = ...)`.
  You will get an `unused argument (.only_common_factors = FALSE)` error. 
  Simply remove the argument to fix it. (#330)
  
- Fixed error in `predict()` when the dataset used to obtain `.object` contained 
  a character column. (#345)
  
### Experimental features

- Add `.fit_measures` argument to `testOMF()`. Now other fit measures such as
  the RMSEA or the GFI can be used as the test statistic. This is a rather
  experimental feature and may be removed in future versions.
  
## Minor changes and bug fixes

- Using `.approach_weights = "GSCA"` for models containing nonlinear terms
  gives a more meaningful error message. (#342)
  
- `print.cSEMTestMICOM()` no longer prints the decision but additional bootstrap
  information. (in parts: #339)
  
- If the weighting scheme is `"PLS-PM"` and `.disattenuate = TRUE`, dissatenuation 
  is longer applied to constructs using modes other than "modeA"" or "modeB". (#352) 
  
- Model-implied indicator correlation matrix for non-recursive models
  should now be calculated correctly. (#264)
  
- `calculatef2()` gives an error when the path model estimator is not "OLS". (#360, #370)

- Add `.type` argument to `calculateGFI()`. Now GFI based on the ML and ULS 
  fitting function can be computed. (#371)

- `csem()` gives a meaningful error when the structural model contains only
  second-order constructs (#366)

- Fix bug in `testMICOM()`. Function produced an error if the data set provided
  contained more columns than indicators used in the model used for 
  `csem()`. (#355)
  
- Fix bug in `testMICOM()`. Function produced an error if the data set provided
  contained an id-column even if the id-column was correctly supplied to 
  `csem()`. (#344, #338)

- When calculating the HTMT via `assess()` the geometric mean of the average 
  monotrait−heteromethod correlation construct eta_i with the average 
  monotrait−heteromethod correlation of other constructs can be negative. 
  NaNs produced are produced in this case and the HTMT was not printed. 
  Added a warning and forced printing the NaNs as well. (#346)

- Add CITATION file (#331)

- Add informative error message if `.data` contains missing values.

- Update vignettes `csem-notation`
