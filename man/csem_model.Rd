\description{
A standardized list containing model-related information. To convert a
a model written in \code{\link[lavaan:model.syntax]{lavaan model syntax}}
to a \code{cSEMModel}-list use \code{\link[=parseModel]{parseModel()}}.
}
\details{
An object of class \code{cSEMModel} is a standardized list containing the following
components (J constructs and K indicators)
\describe{
\item{\code{$structural}}{A matrix mimicking the structural relationship between
constructs. If constructs are only linearly related, \code{structural} is
of dimension (J x J) with row- and column names equal to the construct
names. If the structural model contains non-linear relationships
\code{structural} is (J x (J + J*)) where J* is the number of
nonlinear terms. Rows are ordered such that exogenous constructs are always
first, followed by constructs that only depend on exogenous constructs and/or
previously ordered constructs.}
\item{\code{$measurement}}{A (J x K) matrix mimicking the measurement relationship
between constructs and their related indicators. Rows are in the same
order as the \code{$structural} with row names equal to
the construct names. The order of the columns is such that \code{$.measurement}
forms a block diagonal matrix.}
\item{\code{$error_cor}}{A (K x K) matrix mimicking the measurement error
correlation relationship. The row and column order is identical to \code{$measurement}.}
\item{\code{$construct_type}}{A named vector containing the names of each construct
and their respective type (\strong{"Common factor"} or \strong{"Composite"}).}
\item{\code{$model_type}}{The type of model (linear or nonlinear).}
}
Note: it is possible to supply an incomplete \code{cSEMModel}-list
to all functions that require \code{.csem_model} as a mandatory argument. Currently,
only the structural and the measurement matrix are required.
However, specifying an incomplete cSEMModel list may lead to unexpected behavior
and errors so do use this technique with caution.
