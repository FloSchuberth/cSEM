or "\emph{regression}". Defaults to "\emph{PLS-PM}".}

\item{.disattenuate}{Logical. Should composite/proxy correlations
be disattenuated to yield consistent loadings and path estimates if at least
one of the construct is modeled as a common factor? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

of the list elements are the names of the dependent (LHS) constructs of the structural
equation whose explanatory variables are endogenous. The vectors
contain the names of the instruments corresponding to each equation. Note
that exogenous variables of a given equation \strong{must} be supplied as
instruments for themselves. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{.normality}{Logical. Should joint normality of
\eqn{[\eta_{1:p}; \zeta; \epsilon]}{[\eta_(1:p); \zeta; \epsilon]}

yielded inadmissible results (i.e. number of results returned is equal to \code{.R}).
For "\emph{replace}" resampling continues until there are exactly \code{.R} admissible solutions.
Depending on the frequency of inadmissible solutions this may significantly increase
computing time. Defaults to "\emph{drop}".}

vector but matrices are also accepted. However, the output will be
vectorized (columnwise) in this case. See the examples section for details.}

\value{
An object of class \code{cSEMResults} with methods for all postestimation generics.
Technically, a call to \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}} results in an object with at least
two class attributes. The first class attribute is always \code{cSEMResults}.
The second is one of \code{cSEMResults_default}, \code{cSEMResults_multi}, or
\code{cSEMResults_2ndorder} and depends on the estimated model and/or the type of
data provided to the \code{.model} and \code{.data} arguments. The third class attribute
\code{cSEMResults_resampled} is only added if resampling was conducted.
For a details see the \link[=cSEMResults]{cSEMResults helpfile }.

\description{
Estimate linear, nonlinear, hierarchical or multigroup structural equation
models using a composite-based approach. In \pkg{cSEM}
any method or approach that involves linear compounds (scores/proxies/composites)
of observables (indicators/items/manifest variables) is defined as composite-based.
See the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/articles/cSEM.html}{Get started}
section of the \href{https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM/index.html}{cSEM website}
for a general introduction to composite-based SEM and \pkg{cSEM}.
}
\details{
\code{csem()} estimates linear, nonlinear, hierarchical  or multigroup structural
equation models using a composite-based approach.

\subsection{Data and model:}{
The \code{.data} and \code{.model} arguments are required. \code{.data} must be given
a \code{matrix} or a \code{data.frame} with column names matching
the indicator names used in the model description. Alternatively,
a \code{list} of data sets (matrices or data frames) may be provided
in which case estimation is repeated for each data set.
Possible column types/classes of the data provided are: "\code{logical}",
"\code{numeric}" ("\code{double}" or "\code{integer}"), "\code{factor}" ("\code{ordered}" and/or "\code{unordered}"),
"\code{character}", or a mix of several types. Character columns will be treated
as (unordered) factors.

Depending on the type/class of the indicator data provided cSEM computes the indicator
correlation matrix in different ways. See \code{\link[=calculateIndicatorCor]{calculateIndicatorCor()}} for details.

In the current version \code{.data} must not contain missing values. Future versions
are likely to handle missing values as well.

To provide a model use the \link[lavaan:model.syntax]{lavaan model syntax}.
Note, however, that \pkg{cSEM} currently only supports the "standard" lavaan
model syntax (Types 1, 2, 3, and 7 as described on the help page).
Therefore, specifying e.g., a threshold or scaling factors is ignored.
Alternatively, a standardized (possibly incomplete) \link{cSEMModel}-list may be supplied.
See \code{\link[=parseModel]{parseModel()}} for details.
}

\subsection{Weights and path coefficients:}{
By default weights are estimated using the partial least squares path modeling
algorithm (\code{"PLS-PM"}).
A range of alternative weighting algorithms may be supplied to
\code{.approach_weights}. Currently, the following approaches are implemented
\enumerate{
\item{(Default) Partial least squares path modeling (\code{"PLS-PM"}). The algorithm
can be customized. See \code{\link[=calculateWeightsPLS]{calculateWeightsPLS()}} for details.}
\item{Generalized structured component analysis (\code{"GSCA"}) and generalized
structured component analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm). The algorithms
can be customized. See \code{\link[=calculateWeightsGSCA]{calculateWeightsGSCA()}} and \code{\link[=calculateWeightsGSCAm]{calculateWeightsGSCAm()}} for details.
Note that GSCAm is called indirectly when the model contains constructs
modeled as common factors only and \code{.disattenuate = TRUE}. See below.}
\item{Generalized canonical correlation analysis (\emph{GCCA}), including
\code{"SUMCORR"}, \code{"MAXVAR"}, \code{"SSQCORR"}, \code{"MINVAR"}, \code{"GENVAR"}.}
\item{Principal component analysis (\code{"PCA"})}
\item{Factor score regression using sum scores (\code{"unit"}),
regression (\code{"regression"}) or bartlett scores (\code{"bartlett"})}
}

It is possible to supply starting values for the weighting algorithm
via \code{.starting_values}. The argument accepts a named list of vectors where the
list names are the construct names whose indicator weights the user
wishes to set. The vectors must be named vectors of \code{"indicator_name" = value}
pairs, where \code{value} is the starting weight. See the examples section below for details.

Composite-indicator and composite-composite correlations are properly
disattenuated by default to yield consistent loadings, construct correlations,
and path coefficients if any of the concepts are modeled as a
common factor.

For \emph{PLS-PM} disattenuation is done using \emph{PLSc} \insertCite{Dijkstra2015}{cSEM}.
For \emph{GSCA} disattenuation is done implicitly by using \emph{GSCAm} \insertCite{Hwang2017}{cSEM}.
Weights obtained by \emph{GCCA}, \emph{unit}, \emph{regression}, \emph{bartlett} or \emph{PCA} are
disattenuated using Croon's approach \insertCite{Croon2002}{cSEM}.
Disattenuation my be suppressed by setting \code{.disattenuate = FALSE}.
Note, however, that quantities in this case are inconsistent
estimates for their construct level counterparts if any of the constructs in
the structural model are modeled as a common factor!

By default path coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (\code{.approach_path = "OLS"}).
For linear models, two-stage least squares (\code{"2SLS"}) is available, however, \emph{only if}
\emph{instruments are internal}, i.e., part of the structural model. Future versions
will add support for external instruments if possible. Instruments must be supplied to
\code{.instruments} as a named list where the names
of the list elements are the names of the dependent constructs of the structural
equations whose explanatory variables are believed to be endogenous.
The list consists of vectors of names of instruments corresponding to each equation.
Note that exogenous variables of a given equation \strong{must} be supplied as
instruments for themselves.

If reliabilities are known they can be supplied as \code{"name" = value} pairs to
\code{.reliabilities}, where \code{value} is a numeric value between 0 and 1.
Currently, only supported for "PLS-PM".
}

\subsection{Nonlinear models:}{
If the model contains nonlinear terms \code{csem()} estimates a polynomial structural equation model
using a non-iterative method of moments approach described in
\insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}. Nonlinear terms include interactions and
exponential terms. The latter is described in model syntax as an
"interaction with itself", e.g., \code{xi^3 = xi.xi.xi}. Currently only exponential
terms up to a power of three (e.g., three-way interactions or cubic terms) are allowed.

The current version of the package allows two kinds of estimation:
estimation of the reduced form equation (\code{.approach_nl = "replace"}) and
sequential estimation (\code{.approach_nl = "sequential"}, the default). The latter does not
allow for multivariate normality of all exogenous variables, i.e.,
the latent variables and the error terms.

Distributional assumptions are kept to a minimum (an i.i.d. sample from a
population with finite moments for the relevant order); for higher order models,
that go beyond interaction, we work in this version with the assumption that
as far as the relevant moments are concerned certain combinations of
measurement errors behave as if they were Gaussian.
For details see: \insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}.
}

\subsection{Second-order model}{
Second-order models are specified using the operators \verb{=~} and \verb{<~}. These
operators are usually used with indicators on their right-hand side. For
second-order models the right-hand side variables are constructs instead.
If c1, and c2 are constructs forming or measuring a higher order
construct, a model would look like this:
\preformatted{my_model <- "
# Structural model
SAT  ~ QUAL
VAL  ~ SAT

# Measurement/composite model
QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2

c1 =~ x11 + x12
c2 =~ x21 + x22

# Second-order term (in this case a second-order composite build by common
# factors)
VAL <~ c1 + c2
"
}
Currently, two approaches are explicitly implemented:
\itemize{
\item{(Default) \code{"2stage"}. The (disjoint) two stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Agarwal2000;textual}{cSEM}.}
\item{\code{"mixed"}. The mixed repeated indicators/two-stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Ringle2012;textual}{cSEM}.}
}

The repeated indicators approach as proposed by \insertCite{Joereskog1982b;textual}{cSEM}
and the extension proposed by \insertCite{Becker2012;textual}{cSEM} are
not directly implemented as they simply require a respecification  of the model.
In the above example the repeated indicators approach
would require to change the model and to append the repeated indicators to
the data supplied to \code{.data}. Note that the indicators need to be renamed in this case as
\code{csem()} does not allow for one indicator to be attached to multiple constructs.
\preformatted{my_model <- "
# Structural model
SAT  ~ QUAL
VAL  ~ SAT

VAL ~ c1 + c2

# Measurement/composite model
QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2
VAL  =~ x11_temp + x12_temp + x21_temp + x22_temp

c1 =~ x11 + x12
c2 =~ x21 + x22
"
}
According to the extended approach indirect effects of \code{QUAL} on \code{VAL} via \code{c1}
and \code{c2} would have to be specified as well.
}

\subsection{Multigroup analysis}{
To perform multigroup analysis provide either a list of data sets or one
data set containing a group-identifier-column whose column
name must be provided to \code{.id}. Values of this column are taken as levels of a
factor and are interpreted as group
identifiers. \code{csem()} will split the data by levels of that column and run
the estimation for each level separately. Note that the more levels
the group-identifier-column has, the more estimation runs are required.
This can considerably slow down estimation, especially if resampling is
requested. For the latter it will generally be faster to use
\code{.eval_plan = "multiprocess"}.
}
\subsection{Inference:}{
Inference is done via resampling. See \code{\link[=resamplecSEMResults]{resamplecSEMResults()}} and \code{\link[=infer]{infer()}} for details.
}
}
\section{Postestimation}{

\describe{
\item{\code{\link[=assess]{assess()}}}{Assess results using common quality criteria, e.g., reliability,
fit measures, HTMT, R2 etc.}
\item{\code{\link[=infer]{infer()}}}{Calculate common inferential quantities, e.g., standard errors,
confidence intervals.}

Tests are performed using the test-family of functions. Currently the following
tests are implemented:
\describe{
\item{\code{\link[=testOMF]{testOMF()}}}{Bootstrap-based test for overall model fit based on
\insertCite{Beran1985;textual}{cSEM}}
\item{\code{\link[=testMICOM]{testMICOM()}}}{Permutation-based test for measurement invariance of composites

\item{\code{\link[=testHausman]{testHausman()}}}{Regression-based Hausman test to test for endogeneity.}

Other miscellaneous postestimation functions belong do the do-family of functions.
Currently two do functions are implemented:
