\verb{myFun <- function(.object, ...) \{body-of-the-function\}}).
Function output should preferably be a (named)
vector but matrices are also accepted. However, the output will be
vectorized (columnwise) in this case. See the examples section for details.}

"\emph{sequential}", "\emph{multicore}", or "\emph{multisession}". In the two latter cases
all available cores will be used. Defaults to "\emph{sequential}".}

be used to handle flipping signs when resampling? One of "\emph{none}","\emph{individual}",
"\emph{individual_reestimate}", "\emph{construct_reestimate}". Defaults to "\emph{none}".}

}
\value{
An object of class \code{cSEMResults} with methods for all postestimation generics.
Technically, a call to \code{\link[=csem]{csem()}} results in an object with at least
two class attributes. The first class attribute is always \code{cSEMResults}.
The second is one of \code{cSEMResults_default}, \code{cSEMResults_multi}, or
\code{cSEMResults_2ndorder} and depends on the estimated model and/or the type of
data provided to the \code{.model} and \code{.data} arguments. The third class attribute
\code{cSEMResults_resampled} is only added if resampling was conducted.

\details{
Estimate linear, nonlinear, hierarchical or multigroup structural equation
models using a composite-based approach. In \pkg{cSEM}
any method or approach that involves linear compounds (scores/proxies/composites)
of observables (indicators/items/manifest variables) is defined as composite-based.
See the \href{https://floschuberth.github.io/cSEM/articles/cSEM.html}{Get started}
section of the \href{https://floschuberth.github.io/cSEM/index.html}{cSEM website}
for a general introduction to composite-based SEM and \pkg{cSEM}.

\code{csem()} estimates linear, nonlinear, hierarchical  or multigroup structural
equation models using a composite-based approach.

\subsection{Data and model:}{
The \code{.data} and \code{.model} arguments are required. \code{.data} must be given
a \code{matrix} or a \code{data.frame} with column names matching
the indicator names used in the model description. Alternatively,
a \code{list} of data sets (matrices or data frames) may be provided
in which case estimation is repeated for each data set.
Possible column types/classes of the data provided are: "\code{logical}",
"\code{numeric}" ("\code{double}" or "\code{integer}"), "\code{factor}" ("\code{ordered}" and/or "\code{unordered}"),
"\code{character}", or a mix of several types. Character columns will be treated
as (unordered) factors.

Depending on the type/class of the indicator data provided cSEM computes the indicator
correlation matrix in different ways. See \code{\link[=calculateIndicatorCor]{calculateIndicatorCor()}} for details.

In the current version \code{.data} must not contain missing values. Future versions
are likely to handle missing values as well.

To provide a model use the \link[lavaan:model.syntax]{lavaan model syntax}.
Note, however, that \pkg{cSEM} currently only supports the "standard" lavaan
model syntax (Types 1, 2, 3, and 7 as described on the help page).
Therefore, specifying e.g., a threshold or scaling factors is ignored.
Alternatively, a standardized (possibly incomplete) \link{cSEMModel}-list may be supplied.
See \code{\link[=parseModel]{parseModel()}} for details.
}

\subsection{Weights and path coefficients:}{
By default weights are estimated using the partial least squares path modeling
algorithm (\code{"PLS-PM"}).
A range of alternative weighting algorithms may be supplied to
\code{.approach_weights}. Currently, the following approaches are implemented
\enumerate{
\item{(Default) Partial least squares path modeling (\code{"PLS-PM"}). The algorithm
can be customized. See \code{\link[=calculateWeightsPLS]{calculateWeightsPLS()}} for details.}
\item{Generalized structured component analysis (\code{"GSCA"}) and generalized
structured component analysis with uniqueness terms (GSCAm). The algorithms
can be customized. See \code{\link[=calculateWeightsGSCA]{calculateWeightsGSCA()}} and \code{\link[=calculateWeightsGSCAm]{calculateWeightsGSCAm()}} for details.
Note that GSCAm is called indirectly when the model contains constructs
modeled as common factors only and \code{.disattenuate = TRUE}. See below.}
\item{Generalized canonical correlation analysis (\emph{GCCA}), including
\code{"SUMCORR"}, \code{"MAXVAR"}, \code{"SSQCORR"}, \code{"MINVAR"}, \code{"GENVAR"}.}
\item{Principal component analysis (\code{"PCA"})}
\item{Factor score regression using sum scores (\code{"unit"}),
regression (\code{"regression"}) or bartlett scores (\code{"bartlett"})}
}

It is possible to supply starting values for the weighting algorithm
via \code{.starting_values}. The argument accepts a named list of vectors where the
list names are the construct names whose indicator weights the user
wishes to set. The vectors must be named vectors of \code{"indicator_name" = value}
pairs, where \code{value} is the starting weight. See the examples section below for details.

Composite-indicator and composite-composite correlations are properly
disattenuated by default to yield consistent loadings, construct correlations,
and path coefficients if any of the concepts are modeled as a
common factor.

For \emph{PLS-PM} disattenuation is done using \emph{PLSc} \insertCite{Dijkstra2015}{cSEM}.
For \emph{GSCA} disattenuation is done implicitly by using \emph{GSCAm} \insertCite{Hwang2017}{cSEM}.
Weights obtained by \emph{GCCA}, \emph{unit}, \emph{regression}, \emph{bartlett} or \emph{PCA} are
disattenuated using Croon's approach \insertCite{Croon2002}{cSEM}.
Disattenuation my be suppressed by setting \code{.disattenuate = FALSE}.
Note, however, that quantities in this case are inconsistent
estimates for their construct level counterparts if any of the constructs in
the structural model are modeled as a common factor!

By default path coefficients are estimated using ordinary least squares (\code{.approach_path = "OLS"}).
For linear models, two-stage least squares (\code{"2SLS"}) is available, however, \emph{only if}
\emph{instruments are internal}, i.e., part of the structural model. Future versions
will add support for external instruments if possible. Instruments must be supplied to
\code{.instruments} as a named list where the names
of the list elements are the names of the dependent constructs of the structural
equations whose explanatory variables are believed to be endogenous.
The list consists of vectors of names of instruments corresponding to each equation.
Note that exogenous variables of a given equation \strong{must} be supplied as
instruments for themselves.

If reliabilities are known they can be supplied as \code{"name" = value} pairs to
\code{.reliabilities}, where \code{value} is a numeric value between 0 and 1.
Currently, only supported for "PLS-PM".
}

\subsection{Nonlinear models:}{
If the model contains nonlinear terms \code{csem()} estimates a polynomial structural equation model
using a non-iterative method of moments approach described in
\insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}. Nonlinear terms include interactions and
exponential terms. The latter is described in model syntax as an
"interaction with itself", e.g., \code{xi^3 = xi.xi.xi}. Currently only exponential
terms up to a power of three (e.g., three-way interactions or cubic terms) are allowed:
\enumerate{
\item{- Single, e.g., \code{eta1}}
\item{- Quadratic, e.g., \code{eta1.eta1}}
\item{- Cubic, e.g., \code{eta1.eta1.eta1}}
\item{- Two-way interaction, e.g., \code{eta1.eta2}}
\item{- Three-way interaction, e.g., \code{eta1.eta2.eta3}}
\item{- Quadratic and two-way interaction, e.g., \code{eta1.eta1.eta3}}
}
The current version of the package allows two kinds of estimation:
estimation of the reduced form equation (\code{.approach_nl = "replace"}) and
sequential estimation (\code{.approach_nl = "sequential"}, the default). The latter does not
allow for multivariate normality of all exogenous variables, i.e.,
the latent variables and the error terms.

Distributional assumptions are kept to a minimum (an i.i.d. sample from a
population with finite moments for the relevant order); for higher order models,
that go beyond interaction, we work in this version with the assumption that
as far as the relevant moments are concerned certain combinations of
measurement errors behave as if they were Gaussian.
For details see: \insertCite{Dijkstra2014;textual}{cSEM}.
}

\subsection{Models containing second-order constructs}{
Second-order constructs are specified using the operators \verb{=~} and \verb{<~}. These
operators are usually used with indicators on their right-hand side. For
second-order constructs the right-hand side variables are constructs instead.
If c1, and c2 are constructs forming or measuring a higher-order
construct, a model would look like this:
\preformatted{my_model <- "
# Structural model
SAT  ~ QUAL
VAL  ~ SAT

# Measurement/composite model
QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2

c1 =~ x11 + x12
c2 =~ x21 + x22

# Second-order construct (in this case a second-order composite build by common
# factors)
VAL <~ c1 + c2
"
}
Currently, two approaches are explicitly implemented:
\itemize{
\item{(Default) \code{"2stage"}. The (disjoint) two-stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Agarwal2000;textual}{cSEM}.
Note that by default a correction for attenuation is applied if common factors are
involved in modeling second-order constructs. For instance, the three-stage approach
proposed by \insertCite{VanRiel2017;textual}{cSEM} is applied in case of a second-order construct specified as a
composite of common factors. On the other hand, if no common factors are involved the two-stage approach
is applied as proposed by \insertCite{Schuberth2020;textual}{cSEM}.}
\item{\code{"mixed"}. The mixed repeated indicators/two-stage approach as proposed by \insertCite{Ringle2012;textual}{cSEM}.}
}

The repeated indicators approach as proposed by \insertCite{Joereskog1982b;textual}{cSEM}
and the extension proposed by \insertCite{Becker2012;textual}{cSEM} are
not directly implemented as they simply require a respecification  of the model.
In the above example the repeated indicators approach
would require to change the model and to append the repeated indicators to
the data supplied to \code{.data}. Note that the indicators need to be renamed in this case as
\code{csem()} does not allow for one indicator to be attached to multiple constructs.
\preformatted{my_model <- "
# Structural model
SAT  ~ QUAL
VAL  ~ SAT

VAL ~ c1 + c2

# Measurement/composite model
QUAL =~ qual1 + qual2
SAT  =~ sat1 + sat2
VAL  =~ x11_temp + x12_temp + x21_temp + x22_temp

c1 =~ x11 + x12
c2 =~ x21 + x22
"
}
According to the extended approach indirect effects of \code{QUAL} on \code{VAL} via \code{c1}
and \code{c2} would have to be specified as well.
}

\subsection{Multigroup analysis}{
To perform a multigroup analysis provide either a list of data sets or one
data set containing a group-identifier-column whose column
name must be provided to \code{.id}. Values of this column are taken as levels of a
factor and are interpreted as group
identifiers. \code{csem()} will split the data by levels of that column and run
the estimation for each level separately. Note, the more levels
the group-identifier-column has, the more estimation runs are required.
This can considerably slow down estimation, especially if resampling is
requested. For the latter it will generally be faster to use
\code{.eval_plan = "multisession"} or \code{.eval_plan = "multicore"}.
}
\subsection{Inference:}{
Inference is done via resampling. See \code{\link[=resamplecSEMResults]{resamplecSEMResults()}} and \code{\link[=infer]{infer()}} for details.
}
}

### Multigroup analysis -----------------------------------------------------

# See: ?testMGD()

# ===========================================================================
# Extended usage
# ===========================================================================
# `csem()` provides defaults for all arguments except `.data` and `.model`.
#   Below some common options/tasks that users are likely to be interested in.
#   We use the threecommonfactors data set again:

model <- "
# Structural model
eta2 ~ eta1
eta3 ~ eta1 + eta2

# (Reflective) measurement model
eta1 =~ y11 + y12 + y13
eta2 =~ y21 + y22 + y23
eta3 =~ y31 + y32 + y33
"

### PLS vs PLSc and disattenuation
# In the model all concepts are modeled as common factors. If 
#   .approach_weights = "PLS-PM", csem() uses PLSc to disattenuate composite-indicator 
#   and composite-composite correlations.
res_plsc <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .approach_weights = "PLS-PM")
res$Information$Model$construct_type # all common factors

# To obtain "original" (inconsistent) PLS estimates use `.disattenuate = FALSE`
res_pls <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, 
                .approach_weights = "PLS-PM",
                .disattenuate = FALSE
                )

s_plsc <- summarize(res_plsc)
s_pls  <- summarize(res_pls)

# Compare
data.frame(
  "Path"      = s_plsc$Estimates$Path_estimates$Name,
  "Pop_value" = c(0.6, 0.4, 0.35), # see ?threecommonfactors
  "PLSc"      = s_plsc$Estimates$Path_estimates$Estimate,
  "PLS"       = s_pls$Estimates$Path_estimates$Estimate
  )

### Resampling --------------------------------------------------------------
\dontrun{
## Basic resampling
res_boot <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .resample_method = "bootstrap")
res_jack <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .resample_method = "jackknife")

# See ?resamplecSEMResults for more examples

### Choosing a different weightning scheme ----------------------------------

res_gscam  <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .approach_weights = "GSCA")
res_gsca   <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, 
                   .approach_weights = "GSCA",
                   .disattenuate = FALSE
)

s_gscam <- summarize(res_gscam)
s_gsca  <- summarize(res_gsca)

# Compare
data.frame(
  "Path"      = s_gscam$Estimates$Path_estimates$Name,
  "Pop_value" = c(0.6, 0.4, 0.35), # see ?threecommonfactors
  "GSCAm"      = s_gscam$Estimates$Path_estimates$Estimate,
  "GSCA"       = s_gsca$Estimates$Path_estimates$Estimate
)}
### Fine-tuning a weighting scheme ------------------------------------------
## Setting starting values

sv <- list("eta1" = c("y12" = 10, "y13" = 4, "y11" = 1))
res <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .starting_values = sv)

## Choosing a different inner weighting scheme 
#?args_csem_dotdotdot

res <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .PLS_weight_scheme_inner = "factorial",
            .PLS_ignore_structural_model = TRUE)


## Choosing different modes for PLS
# By default, concepts modeled as common factors uses PLS Mode A weights.
modes <- list("eta1" = "unit", "eta2" = "modeB", "eta3" = "unit")
res   <- csem(threecommonfactors, model, .PLS_modes = modes)
summarize(res)
