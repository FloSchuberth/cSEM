\item{.benchmark}{Character string. The procedure to obtain benchmark predictions.
One of "\emph{lm}", "\emph{unit}", "\emph{PLS-PM}", "\emph{GSCA}", "\emph{PCA}", or "\emph{MAXVAR}".
Default to "\emph{lm}".}

\item{.cv_folds}{Integer. The number of cross-validation folds to use. Setting
\code{.cv_folds} to \code{N} (the number of observations) produces
leave-one-out cross-validation samples. Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{.handle_inadmissibles}{Character string. How should inadmissible results
be treated? One of "\emph{stop}", "\emph{ignore}", or "\emph{set_NA}". If "\emph{stop}", \code{\link[=predict]{predict()}}
will stop immediatly if estimation yields an inadmissible result.
For "\emph{ignore}" all results are returned even if all or some of the estimates
yielded inadmissible results.
For "\emph{set_NA}" predictions based on inadmissible parameter estimates are
set to \code{NA}. Defaults to "\emph{stop}"}

\item{.r}{Integer. The number of repetitions to use. Defaults to \code{10}.}

\item{.test_data}{A matrix of test data with the same column names as the
training data.}

\item{.approach_score_target}{Character string. How should the aggregation of the estimates of
the truncated normal distribution for the predictions using OrdPLS/OrdPLSc be done?
One of "\emph{mean}" or "\emph{median}" or "\emph{mode}".
If "\emph{mean}", the mean of the estimated endogenous indicators is calculated.
If "\emph{median}", the mean of the estimated endogenous indicators is calculated.
If "\emph{mode}", the maximum empirical density on the intervals defined by the thresholds
is used. Defaults to "\emph{mean}".}

\item{.sim_points}{integer. How many samples from the truncated normal distribution should
be simulated to estimate the exogenous construct scores? Defaults to "\emph{100}".}

\item{.disattenuate}{logical. Should the benchmark predictions be based on
disattenuated parameter estimates? Defaults to "\emph{TRUE}".}

\item{.treat_as_continuous}{logical. Should the indicators for the benchmark predictions
be treated as continuous? If "\emph{TRUE}" all indicators are treated as continuous and also
in case of categorical indicators PLS-PM/PLSc is applied. If "\emph{FALSE}" in case of
categorical indicators OrdPLS/OrdPLSc is applied. Defaults to "\emph{TRUE}".}

\item{.approach_score_benchmark}{Character string. How should the aggregation of the estimates of
the truncated normal distribution be done for the benchmark predictions? Is ignored
if not OrdPLS or OrdPLSc is used as benchmark predictions.
One of "\emph{mean}" or "\emph{median}" or "\emph{mode}" or "\emph{round}".
If "\emph{round}", the benchmark predictions are obtained using the traditional prediction
algorithm for PLS-PM which are rounded for categorical indicators.
If "\emph{mean}", the mean of the estimated endogenous indicators is calculated.
If "\emph{median}", the mean of the estimated endogenous indicators is calculated.
If "\emph{mode}", the maximum empirical density on the intervals defined by the thresholds
is used.
If "\emph{.treat_as_continuous}" = TRUE or if all indicators are on a continuous scale,
.approach_score_benchmark is ignored. Defaults to "\emph{round}".}

Predict the indicator scores of endogenous constructs.

Predict uses the procedure introduced by \insertCite{Shmueli2016;textual}{cSEM} in the context of
PLS (commonly called: "PLSPredict" \insertCite{Shmueli2019}{cSEM}).
Predict uses k-fold cross-validation to randomly
split the data into training and test data and subsequently predicts the
relevant values in the test data based on the model parameter estimates obtained
using the training data. The number of cross-validation folds is 10 by default but
may be changed using the \code{.cv_folds} argument.
By default, the procedure is repeated \code{.r = 10} times to avoid irregularities
due to a particular split. See \insertCite{Shmueli2019;textual}{cSEM} for
details.

Alternatively, users may supply a matrix or a data frame of \code{.test_data} with
the same column names as those in the data used to obtain \code{.object} (the training data).
In this case, arguments \code{.cv_folds} and \code{.r} are
ignored and predict uses the estimated coefficients from \code{.object} to
predict the values in the columns of \code{.test_data}.

In \insertCite{Shmueli2016;textual}{cSEM} PLS-based predictions for indicator \code{i}
are compared to the predictions based on a multiple regression of indicator \code{i}
on all available exogenous indicators (\code{.benchmark = "lm"}) and
a simple mean-based prediction summarized in the Q2_predict metric.
\code{predict()} is more general in that is allows users to compare the predictions
based on a so-called target model/specification to predictions based on an
alternative benchmark. Available benchmarks include predictions
based on a linear model, PLS-PM weights, unit weights (i.e. sum scores),
GSCA weights, PCA weights, and MAXVAR weights.

Each estimation run is checked for admissibility using \code{\link[=verify]{verify()}}. If the
estimation yields inadmissible results, \code{predict()} stops with an error (\code{"stop"}).
Users may choose to \code{"ignore"} inadmissible results or to simply set predictions
to \code{NA} (\code{"set_NA"}) for the particular run that failed.
