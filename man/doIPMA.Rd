\details{
Performs an importance-performance matrix analysis (IPMA).

To calculate the performance and importance, the weights of the indicators
are unstandardized using the standard deviation of the original
indicators but normed to have a length of 1.
Normed construct scores are calculated based on the original indicators and the
unstandardized weights.

The importance is calculated as the mean of
the original indicators or the unstandardized construct scores, respectively.
The performance is calculated as the unstandardized total effect if
\code{.level == "construct"} and as the normed weight times the unstandardized
total effect if \code{.level == "indicator"}. The literature recommends to use an
estimation as input for `\code{\link[=doIPMA]{doIPMA()}} that is based on normed
indicators, e.g., by scaling all indicators to 0 to 100,
see e.g., \insertCite{Henseler2021,Ringle2016;textual}{cSEM}.

Note, indicators are not normed internally, as theoretical maximum/minimum can
differ from the empirical maximum/minimum which would lead to an incorrect normalization.
