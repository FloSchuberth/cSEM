<h3 id="commonfactor">Common factor<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#commonfactor"></a>
</h3>
<p>A common factor or latent variable is a type of <a href="#construct">construct</a>. The name common factor is motivated by
the theorized relationship to its <a href="#indicator">indicators</a>.
This relation is commonly referred to as the <a href="#mm">measurement
model</a>. Two kinds of measurement models exist: the reflective and the
(causal-)formative measurement model. The defining feature of a common
factor in a reflective measurement model is the idea that the common
factor is the common underlying (latent) cause of the realizations of a
set of indicators that are said to measure the common factor. The idea
of the reflective measurement model is closely related to the <a href="#truescore">true score</a> theory. Accordingly, indicators related
to the common factor are modeled as measurement error-prone
manifestations of a common variable, cause or factor. Although there are
subtle conceptional differences, the terms common factor, true score,
and latent variable are mostly used synonymously in
<strong>cSEM</strong>.</p>
<p>The common factor is also the central entity in the causal-formative
measurement model. Here the indicators are modeled as causing the/one
common factor. This type of measurement looks similar to the <a href="#composite">composite (measurement) model</a>, however, both
models are, in fact, quite different. While the causal-formative
measurement model assumes that the common factor is imperfectly measured
by its indicators (i.e., there is an error term with non-zero variance)
the composite in a composite model is build/defined by its indicators,
i.e., error-free by definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="composite">Composite<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#composite"></a>
</h3>
<p>A composite is a weighted sum of <a href="#indicator">indicators</a>.
Composites may either serve as <a href="#construct">constructs</a> in
their own right or as <a href="#proxy">proxies</a> for a <a href="#latentvariable">latent variable</a> which, in turn, serves as a
“statistical proxy” for a <a href="#concept">concept</a> under study.
The nature of the composite is therefore defined by the type of
(measurement) model. If composites are error-free representations of a
concept we refer to the measurement model as the composite (measurement)
model. If composites are used as <a href="#standin">stand-ins</a> for a
<a href="#latentvariable">latent variable</a>, the measurement model is
called causal-formative <span class="citation">(Henseler
2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that, although we sometimes use it this way as well, the term
“measurement” is actually rather inadequate for the composite model
since in a composite model the construct is build/formed by its related
indicators. Hence no measurement in the actual sense of the word takes
place.</p>

<p>Composite-based methods or composite-based SEM refers to the entirety

methods are often also called variance-based methods as focal parameters
are usually retrieved such that explained variance of the dependent

</h3>
<p>An entity defined by a conceptual/theoretical definition. In line
with <span class="citation">Rigdon (2016)</span> variables representing
or subsuming a concept are called conceptual variables. The precise
nature/meaning of a conceptual variable depends on “different
assumptions, philosophies or worldviews [of the researcher]” <span class="citation">(Rigdon 2016, 2)</span>. Unless otherwise stated, in
<strong>cSEM</strong>, it is sufficient to think of concepts as entities
that exist simply because they have been defined. Hence, abstract terms
such as “loyalty” or “depression” as well as designed entities
(artifacts) such as the “OECD Better Life Index” are covered by the
definition.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="construct">Construct<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#construct"></a>
</h3>
<p>Construct refers to a representation of a <a href="#concept">concept</a> within a given statistical model. While a
concept is defined by a conceptual (theoretical) definition, a construct
for a concept is defined/created by the researcher’s operationalization
of a concept within a statistical model. Concepts are either modeled as
common factors/latent variables or as composites. Both
operationalizations - the common factor and the composite - are called
constructs in <strong>cSEM</strong>. As opposed to concepts, constructs
therefore exist because they arise as the result of the act of modeling
their relation to the observable variables (indicators) based on a
specific set of assumptions. Constructs may therefore best be understood
as <a href="#standin">stand-ins</a>, i.e. statistical proxies for
concepts. Consequently, constructs do not necessarily represent the
concept they seek to represent, i.e., there may be a validity gap.</p>

<p>The measurement model is a statistical model relating <a href="#indicator">indicators</a> to <a href="#construct">constructs</a>
(the statistical representation of a <a href="#concept">concept</a>). If
the concept under study is modeled as a <a href="#commonfactor">common
factor</a> two measurement models exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reflective measurement model</li>
<li>The causal-formative measurement model</li>
</ul>
<p>If the concept under study is modeled as a <a href="#composite">composite</a> we call the measurement model:</p>
<ul>
<li>composite (measurement) model</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, although we sometimes use it this way as well, the term
“measurement” is actually rather inadequate for the composite model
since in a composite model the construct is build/formed by its related
indicators. Hence no measurement in the actual sense of the word takes
place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="model">Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many ways to define the term “model”. In
<strong>cSEM</strong> we use the term model to refer to both the
theoretical and the statistical model.</p>
<p>Simply speaking theoretical models are a formalized set of hypotheses
stating if and how entities (observable or unobservable) are related.
Since theoretical models are by definition theoretical any statistical
analysis inevitably mandates a statistical model.</p>
<p>A statistical model is typically defined by a set of (testable)
restrictions. Statistical models are best understood as the
operationalized version of the theoretical model. Note that the act of
operationalizing a given theoretical model always entails the
possibility for error. Using a <a href="#construct">construct</a>
modeled as a <a href="#composite">composite</a> or a <a href="#commonfactor">common factor</a>, for instance, is an attempt to
map a theoretical entity (the <a href="#concept">concept</a>) from the
theoretical space into the statistical space. If this mapping is not
one-to-one the construct is only an imperfect representation of the
concept. Consequently, there is a validity gap.</p>
<p>NOTE: Note that we try to refrain from using the term “model” when
describing an estimation approach or algorithm such as partial least
squares (PLS) as this helps to clearly distinguish between the model and
the approach used to estimate <em>a given model</em>.</p>

<h3 id="testscore">Test score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#testscore"></a>
</h3>
<p>A <a href="#proxy">proxy</a> for a <a href="#truescore">true
score</a>. Usually, the test score is a simple (unweighted) sum score of
<a href="#indicators">observables/indicators</a>, i.e. unit weights are
assumed when building the test score. More generally, the test score can
be any weighted sum of observables (i.e. a <a href="#composite">composite</a>), however, the term “test score” is
historically closely tied to the idea that it is indeed a simple sum
score. Hence, whenever it is important to distinguish between a true
score as representing a sum score and a true score as representing a
weighted sum of indicators (where indicator weights a not necessarily
one) we will explicitly state what kind of test score we mean.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="truescore">True score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#truescore"></a>
</h3>
<p>The term true score derives from the true score theory which
theorizes/models an <a href="#indicator">indicator</a> or outcome as the
sum of a true score and an error score. The term is closely linked to
the <a href="#commonfactor">latent variable/common factor</a> model in
that the true score of a set of indicators are linear functions of some
underlying common factor. Mathematically speaking, the correspondence is

be used synonymously to the terms common factor and latent variable in
<strong>cSEM</strong> without risking a misunderstanding.</p>

a stand-in/proxy for a common factor if not used as a composite in its
