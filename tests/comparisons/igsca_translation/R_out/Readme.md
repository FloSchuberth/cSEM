The name of each folder indicates when the switch between `matlab` and `R` objects was made in `igsca_sim`.

The name of the objects in each folder indicates the saved `R` environment at the step.

Note that the `R` environment is always saved before the `matlab` objects are swapped in. Therefore, in the folder `/prepare_for_ALS/` the `prepare_for_ALS.Rds` is what happened in R before any swapping with the R objects occurs.
