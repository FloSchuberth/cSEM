  comment   = {Partial Least Squares as applied to models with latent variables, measured indirectly by indicators,
is well-known to be inconsistent. The linear compounds of indicators that PLS substitutes for the latent
variables do not obey the equations that the latter satisfy. We propose simple, non-iterative corrections
leading to consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN)-estimators for the loadings and for the correlations
between the latent variables. Moreover, we show how to obtain CAN-estimators for the parameters of
structural recursive systems of equations, containing linear and interaction terms, without the need to
specify a particular joint distribution. If quadratic and higher order terms are included, the approach will
produce CAN-estimators as well when predictor variables and error terms are jointly normal.We compare
the adjusted PLS, denoted by PLSc, with Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS), using Monte
Carlo studies and an empirical application.},

The method is also helpful in exploring the factorial structure of an item set, and its use in scale reliability estimation and development is illustrated. The modeling. estimator of composite reliability it yields does not possess the general underestimation property of Cronbach's coefficient a.},
