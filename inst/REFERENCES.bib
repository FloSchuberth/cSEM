  comment   = {Partial Least Squares as applied to models with latent variables, measured indirectly by indicators,
is well-known to be inconsistent. The linear compounds of indicators that PLS substitutes for the latent
variables do not obey the equations that the latter satisfy. We propose simple, non-iterative corrections
leading to consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN)-estimators for the loadings and for the correlations
between the latent variables. Moreover, we show how to obtain CAN-estimators for the parameters of
structural recursive systems of equations, containing linear and interaction terms, without the need to
specify a particular joint distribution. If quadratic and higher order terms are included, the approach will
produce CAN-estimators as well when predictor variables and error terms are jointly normal.We compare
the adjusted PLS, denoted by PLSc, with Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS), using Monte
Carlo studies and an empirical application.},

  abstract  = {The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},

  abstract  = {Discriminant validity assessment has become a
generally accepted prerequisite for analyzing relationships
between latent variables. For variance-based structural equation
modeling, such as partial least squares, the Fornell-
Larcker criterion and the examination of cross-loadings are
the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant validity.
By means of a simulation study, we show that these approaches
do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity
in common research situations. We therefore propose an
alternative approach, based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix,
to assess discriminant validity: the heterotrait-monotrait
ratio of correlations.We demonstrate its superior performance
by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, in which we
compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion
and the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings. Finally, we
provide guidelines on how to handle discriminant validity
issues in variance-based structural equation modeling.},
